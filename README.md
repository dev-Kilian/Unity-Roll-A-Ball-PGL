# Unity-Roll-A-Ball-PGL
 Simple 3D game to learn the basics of Unity.

 THE MOST RECENT BUILD OF THE GAME IS 'Roll-A-Ball.exe'!!

 I accidentally deleted the old README. In the nearby future it will be replaced with the correct one.

 Major changes of the 0.0.2 version are the inclusion of a new stage and the possibility to swap between the two (at the moment) levels available.
